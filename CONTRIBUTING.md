# Contribution Guidelines

First of all,
we thank your interest in the project
and the time you are willing to contribute! :+1:

The following list is a set of guidelines
we would like our contributors to know
before contributing to the [ko-nlp](https://github.com/ko-nlp/) projects.

## Code of Conduct

As we are still a very early project,
we do not have a code of conduct of our own.
However, as the provenance of this work is from the NLP community,
we follow the [ACL Code of Ethics](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-code-ethics) -
which in turn is an adoption of the [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics),
with the following exception:

Sec 4.2 should be read as follows:

"4.2 Each project contributor should encourage and support adherence by all computing professionals regardless of the fact that they are an external contributor or project contributor. Contributors who recognize a breach of the Code should consider reporting the violation to the project owners, which may result in remedial action, such as a permanent ban to project and even Github."

## How Can I Contribute?

Our project is open to both issue reports and pull requests.

There are different templates for different cases,
which lets us better know what the request is about.
To know what template you should use,
please refer to the individual guidelines below.

### Reporting Bugs

Open source projects have bugs!
If you have found one,
then please let us know!
We welcome submitting the report as an issue,
or through a pull request.
Don't be intimidated by sending in a pull request -
we will make sure to be respectful in the review process for pull requests. 

When reporting a bug, please use the [Standard issue report template](#).

### Adding New Resources

You may either request this through a pull request or an issue.

Do note that the general rule of thumb
when adding a new Korean resource
is that it must be first added to
the [Open Korean Corpora](https://github.com/ko-nlp/Open-korean-corpora) project
before it is submitted to any other project.
As the project ensures that
the usage terms are made explicit,
it makes it more accessible to users of the resource 
if they can use this for the work they have in mind or not.

When reporting a bug, please use the [New resource issue report template](#).

### Requesting Removal of Resource(s)

:cry: We'd prefer this doesn't happen,
but there are times a resource has to be removed.
If this is due to a copyright claim (DMCA),
we would appreciate it
**if you contact us before contacting Github**
to find a resolution that works for all parties involved.

Please keep in mind that removal of a resource
may effectively obsolete any previous baselines
which have been made using this resource.

Please request this through a pull request or an issue.
We may need to ask some questions on the background for the removal request,
along with some verification
on whether or not the provenance of the request
comes from the resource or copyright author.

When reporting a bug, please use the [Resource removal issue report template](#).

### Pull Requests

## Style

We use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) for Markdown documentation,
and generally follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.

For textual content,
we use South Korean as the preferred Korean variant (ko_KR),
and American English and the preferred English variant. (en_US)

### Language

The lingua franca of each project is different.
If you are to submit textual content
that is intended to be consumed by a human to any of the projects,
respect the lingua franca of the project
and submit the pull request using the language that the project is using.

If you need writing assistance,
for instance - due to not being a native speaker of the language,
feel free to reach out to the maintainers for help!

### Markdown Notes

When writing Markdown documentation,
please break a line at least after every sentence.
If possible, try to break
whenever you have a logical break.

After each paragraph, please break twice.

You can refer to the [source of this document](https://github.com/ko-nlp/Open-korean-corpora/raw/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
if you want to see an example of the writing style.
