## Open Korean Corpora: A Living Document for Korean NLP Dataset Curation

### Overview
- Korean, a language with 80M users is often overlooked in NLP research
- The availability of public datasets and tasks has hindered investigation
- Even the publicly available datasets are not always accompanied by English documentation and have poor discoverability
- Our work attempts to tackle this problem by curating a living document of open resources for the Korean language

### Public Institutions
Multiple government-funded institutions create datasets for the Korean language
- National Institute of Korean Language (NIKL)
- Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)
- NIA AI HUB
#### Generally, government funded datasets tend to be very restrictive at allowing access to non-Korean citizens
#### Thus, *Open Corpora* here denotes a freely accessible and downloadable (at least only with a simple sign-in) dataset

### Open dataset for Korean NLP
Our work focuses on curating open Korean corpora under the following criteria:
- Documentation status
- License for use and distribution
